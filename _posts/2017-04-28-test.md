[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is still very alien to me and I want to write
a bit of code in it to get a feeling of the concepts and restrictions itenforces.

## The use case

I worked through Rust examples but they always feel theoretical and artificial.
To get dirty with something real I thought of playing with something concrete.
Being a big fan of [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/) (a reverse proxy that
sits in front of your web application and caches HTTP requests) - that sounds
interesting to emulate in Rust? Disclaimer: I have never looked at the Varnish
source code and I will probably make very obvious mistakes.

Goals:
* write something like Varnish that caches HTTP GET requests.
* use as a lot of already existing work (Rust HTTP libraries) to avoid writing
too much code.
* iterate in smaller goals to quickly get something working.

With that in mind I have set out the requirement for the first step:

> A webserver like Apache is listening on port 80. Write a reverse proxy
> service that does nothing but forwarding HTTP requests to port 80. The service
> must listen on port 9090. The service must not modify the HTTP response in any
> way.

## Installing Rust

I'm using Ubuntu as operating system and everything was very straight forward
by [following the installation
instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html):

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

That single script installs all rust command line utilities you need into your
home directory thereby not messing up your global Ubuntu system (yay!). It
gives you the following:

* ```rustup```: tool chain installer that installs/updates all the Rust things
(run ```rustup update``` to update Rust itself)
* ```rustc```: the compiler that turns your Rust code into executables
* ```cargo```: the Rust package and dependency manager, as well as build tool

## Project setup

We can use ```cargo``` to create a new project:

```
cargo new --bin rustnish
```

That creates a new folder "rustnish" (the project name) and the ```--bin```
option tells cargo to create a standalone application (instead of a library).

## Running the project

Cargo has created a "Hello World!" example in src/main.rs in our project. We
can execute it like this:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling rustnish v0.1.0 (file:///home/klausi/workspace/rustnish)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26 secs
     Running `target/debug/rustnish`
Hello, world!
```

Success! With cargo you don't have to think about compiler commands or anything -
 whenever you modify your source files just execute ```cargo run``` and it
will detect file changes and compile everything for you. A big thank you to the
Rust community at this point for providing such excellent tooling with the
language itself!

## Picking an editor

[areweideyet.com](https://areweideyet.com/) lists editors and Integrated
Development Environments (IDE) for Rust. I chose [Atom](https://atom.io/)
because it seems to have the most IDE features. Make sure to install all the
additional packages on
[https://areweideyet.com/#atom](https://areweideyet.com/#atom). Also make sure
to install ```rustfmt``` which can automatically format your code:

```
cargo install rustfmt
```

It is crucial to have good language support for navigating around in source
code. While working with Atom I really missed the functionality to click on
functions or types to jump to their definition with Ctrl+Click. That works in
Netbeans for example for Java and PHP and I would be really grateful if
somebody could show me how to do that in Atom and Rust.

## Installing a HTTP library

After a bit of research I found [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/) for Rust. That will
give us a client and server library to deal with HTTP requests so that we don't
need to parse HTTP requests ourselves.

Edit Cargo.toml in your project and add a dependency line:

```toml
[dependencies]
hyper = "0.10.9"
```

The next time you execute ```cargo run``` it will fetch the Hyper dependency
for you, compile everything and then run your program. Super easy!
