Rust is still very alien to me and I want to write a bit of code in it to get a
feeling of the concepts and restrictions it enforces.

## The use case

I worked through Rust examples but they always feel theoretical and artifical. I want
to get dirty with something real. I'm a big fan of
[Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/), a reverse proxy that sits in front of
your web application and caches HTTP requests. Disclaimer: I have never looked
at the Varnish source code and I will probably make very obvious mistakes.

Goals:
* write something like Varnish that caches HTTP GET requests.
* use as a lot of already existing work (Rust HTTP libaries) to avoid writing too much code.
* iterate in smaller goals to quickly get something working.

With that in mind I have set out the requirement for the first step:

A webserver like Apache is listening on port 80. Write a reverse proxy service
that does nothing but forwarding HTTP requests to port 80. The service must
listen on port 9090. The service must not modify the HTTP response in any way.

## Installing Rust

I'm using Ubuntu as operating system
