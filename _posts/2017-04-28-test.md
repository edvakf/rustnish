[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is still very alien to me and I want to write a bit of code in it to get a
feeling of the concepts and restrictions it enforces.

## The use case

I worked through Rust examples but they always feel theoretical and artifical. To get dirty with something real I thought of playing with something concrete. Being a big fan of
[Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/) (a reverse proxy that sits in front of
your web application and caches HTTP requests) that sounds interesting to emulate in Rust? Disclaimer: I have never looked
at the Varnish source code and I will probably make very obvious mistakes.

Goals:
* write something like Varnish that caches HTTP GET requests.
* use as a lot of already existing work (Rust HTTP libaries) to avoid writing too much code.
* iterate in smaller goals to quickly get something working.

With that in mind I have set out the requirement for the first step:

> A webserver like Apache is listening on port 80. Write a reverse proxy service
that does nothing but forwarding HTTP requests to port 80. The service must
listen on port 9090. The service must not modify the HTTP response in any way.

## Installing Rust

I'm using Ubuntu as operating system and everything was very straight forward by [following the installation steps](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). That single script installs all rust command line utilities you need into your home directory thereby not messing up your global Ubuntu system (yay!). It gives you the followwing:

* ```rustup```: toolchain installer that installs/updates all the Rust things (run ```rustup update``` to update Rust itself)
* ```rustc```: the compiler that turns your Rust code into executables
* ```cargo```: the Rust package and depedency manager, as well as build tool

## Project setup

We can use ```cargo``` to create a new project:

```
cargo new --bin rustnish
```

That creates a new folder "rustnish" (the project name) and the ```--bin``` option tells cargo to create a standalone application (instead of a library).

## Running the project

Cargo has created a "Hello World!" example in src/main.rs in our project. We can execute it like this:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling rustnish v0.1.0 (file:///home/klausi/workspace/rustnish)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26 secs
     Running `target/debug/rustnish`
Hello, world!
```

Success! With cargo you don't have to think about compiler commands or anything - whenever you modify your source files just execute ```cargo run``` and it will detect file changes and compile everything for you. A big thank you to the Rust community at this point for providing such execellent tooling with the language itself!
